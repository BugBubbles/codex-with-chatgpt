# Troubleshooting

First move, always:

```
c2c doctor
```

It checks Node, workspace, bridge, MCP, OAuth and tunnel — and repairs what it
can (restarts the bridge, restarts the tunnel) without asking.

## Common situations

### "Bridge 未运行"
`c2c start` (or let doctor do it). Bridge logs:
`c2c logs`, or verbose: `c2c logs --verbose`.

If doctor says the bridge state is **uncertain** (无法确认), do not start a
second bridge and do not Delete the ChatGPT connector. Wait and run doctor
again. The local process may still be running.

### Everything was quit and ChatGPT can no longer connect
Quitting Codex / the terminal stops the public address. The next `c2c doctor`
starts a new address and reports each affected item in
`chatgptRepair.connectors`. Delete and recreate each affected service connector
with its new URL (never click Reconnect — the old URL is dead). Other
workspaces keep their own connectors.

Mint a code only when that service's ChatGPT Authorize form is open:
`c2c pair --server <id>`. Each one-time code authorizes only that service.
After reconnecting, test a tool supplied by each MCP connector; this branch no
longer exposes `workspace_info`.

Fixed ChatGPT pages for first-time setup and later repair (do not hunt the UI):

- Developer mode: https://chatgpt.com/#settings/Security
- Plugins hub (manage existing connectors): https://chatgpt.com/plugins
- Add a connector:
  https://chatgpt.com/plugins#settings/Connectors?create-connector=true&redirectAfter=%2Fplugins

### Tunnel URL unreachable / ChatGPT says the connector is broken
Same as above: `c2c doctor`, then delete and recreate each connector listed in
`chatgptRepair.connectors`. Mint its code with `c2c pair --server <id>` only
when that service's Authorize form is on screen.
If this workspace uses a stable hostname, doctor sets `namedRepair` instead —
re-login to Cloudflare (`c2c tunnel login`) and doctor again. Do not Delete
the connector; the address did not change.

### I have a Cloudflare domain and want a stable hostname
During first-time setup (or the next coding session, once), say you have a
Cloudflare account and give the domain. Codex opens a browser for Cloudflare
login, then keeps `c2c-<project>.your-domain.com`. To stay on the temporary
address, say you do not have a domain. Switching later: tell Codex you want
the stable hostname; it runs `c2c tunnel choose --mode named --zone <domain>`.

### "配对码无效/过期"
Pairing codes are one-time and expire after ~5 minutes. Generate one only
when the ChatGPT Authorize page is ready:

```
c2c pair --server <id>
```

Creating a new code for the same service invalidates its previous code. Codes
for different services can remain active at the same time. Do not mint a code
during `c2c doctor`.

### Temporary address keeps dropping on a UDP-filtered network
cloudflared defaults to QUIC. If the tunnel reconnects over and over on a
corporate network, set `C2C_TUNNEL_PROTOCOL=http2` and restart the bridge.
Leave it unset to keep cloudflared's default.

### ChatGPT gets 401 or 403 on a tool call
New access and refresh tokens do not expire by time; they remain valid until
revoked and are restricted to the exact service URL used during authorization.
Tokens issued before this policy change retain their original expiration, so
authorize that connector once more to receive non-expiring tokens.

A `401` means the token is missing, unknown, expired, or revoked. A `403` with
`This token is not authorized for this MCP service` means the token belongs to
a different service URL or public tunnel origin; it is not an expiry error.
Update the affected connector to the current service URL, then authorize it
with a fresh service-specific pairing code. Never use Reconnect when the
public address has been replaced.

### cloudflared is not installed
macOS: `brew install cloudflared`
Windows: `winget install Cloudflare.cloudflared`
Linux: see Cloudflare's package instructions.
The Skill installs this automatically during setup.
If cloudflared is installed in a custom location that is not on `PATH`, set
`C2C_CLOUDFLARED_PATH` to the executable's absolute path before running `c2c`.

### Every new Codex chat “repairs” the connection / cannot write logs
The C2C state directory lives outside the project (macOS:
`~/Library/Application Support/codex-with-chatgpt`; Windows:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\codex-with-chatgpt`). Codex's default sandbox cannot write
there, so each new chat looks like a health-check failure.

`c2c setup`, `c2c doctor` and `c2c sandbox-allow` add that directory to
`[sandbox_workspace_write].writable_roots` in `~/.codex/config.toml`
(`%USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml` on Windows). After that, later chats
do not need elevation.

### Port already in use
Handled automatically: an existing healthy bridge for the same workspace is
reused; anything else makes the bridge pick a free port. Configuration follows
automatically.

### Reading a file returns ACCESS_DENIED_SENSITIVE_FILE
Working as intended: `.env`, keys, credentials and anything matched by
`.c2cignore` are never readable through ChatGPT. `.env.example` is allowed.

### I cannot see Projects in the ChatGPT sidebar
Hover **Chats** /「聊天」, click the … that appears, and choose
**Organize by project** /「按项目整理」. Then create a project named after
this workspace, with **project-only memory**. Tell Codex「好了」when the
collection page is open (`https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-…/project`).

### This workspace opened the wrong ChatGPT Project
Do not pick another project by name automatically. Open the collection that
matches this workspace and tell Codex「已找到」, or say you want the old
long-chat instead. Each workspace has its own Project and its own service connectors.

### Completely stuck
```
c2c stop
c2c setup
```

re-creates the bridge and tunnel, then lists one connector per discovered
service. Authorize each one with its own `c2c pair --server <id>` code.
Existing authorizations stay valid unless you also ran `c2c unpair`.
